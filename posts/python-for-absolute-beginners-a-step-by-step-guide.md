# Python Tutorial for Beginners to Advanced: The Complete Guide


Python is one of the most popular programming languages today. It's beginner-friendly, versatile, and widely used in **web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and AI**. In this tutorial, we'll start from the basics and move toward more advanced Python concepts to help you build a strong foundation.



## Why Learn Python?

- **Readable Syntax:** Simple and intuitive syntax makes it easy for beginners.  
- **Massive Community:** Millions of developers and tons of open-source libraries.  
- **Career Opportunities:** Python is in high demand across industries.  
- **Multi-domain Use:** Web apps, AI/ML, data analysis, automation, cybersecurity, and more.  



## Installing Python

1. Download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and make sure to check **“Add Python to PATH”**.
3. Verify installation by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

## Writing The First Python Program

Let’s start with the classic “Hello, World!” program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this in a file named hello.py, then run:
```bash
python hello.py
```

## Basic Concepts
### Variables and Data Types

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```


Python automatically detects the type of variable — no need to declare explicitly.

### Control Flow

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
```

### Loops

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Data Structures

### Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("mango")
print(fruits)
```

### Tuples, Dictionary & Sets

```python
# tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"}
print(student["name"])

#Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```

## Functions

Functions help organize and reuse your code.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Suman"))
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Python supports full-fledged OOP concepts.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

student1 = Student("Alice", 21)
student1.introduce()
```

## Working with Libraries

Python’s strength lies in its vast ecosystem of libraries.

Domain	Libraries
- Web Development	Flask, Django, FastAPI
- Data Science	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning	Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Automation	Selenium, PyAutoGUI
- APIs	Requests, HTTPx

Example using requests:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)
```

## Advanced Python Concepts

```python
# List Comprehensions

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```


```python
# Lambda Functions

multiply = lambda a, b: a * b
print(multiply(3, 4))
```


```python
# Decorators
def logger(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Function is running...")
        func()
        print("Function has finished.")
    return wrapper

@logger
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

```python
# Generators
def generate_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

for num in generate_numbers(5):
    print(num)
```

## File Handling

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## Virtual Environments

To manage dependencies:

```python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```


## Conclusion

Python is a journey start small, practice consistently, and soon you'll be building amazing projects. 

Keep coding, keep learning!
